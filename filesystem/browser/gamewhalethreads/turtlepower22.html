            <div class="title">A Quest for Treasure Knight
            <div class="content">If you are reading this, then you, like me, might be looking for an ORIGINAL UNALTERED UNCENSORED Treasure Knight experience. This post essentially documents my journey trying to find and play a pure copy of Treasure Knight for my Treasure-Like Retrospective series (coming soon!!). But be warned. The path <i>will</i> test your hyperweb skills in ways you might not expect. If you are still willing to try, you will need three mythical items hidden is distant corners of the hyperweb. 

                <ul>
                    <li>Emulaton (The Salvaged)</li>
                    <li>Nano-DOS-ware (The Micro Controller)</li>
                    <li>Treasure Knight Original, guarded by Doctor Popup (Doc Pop)</li>
                </ul>
            
            Follow these instructions very carefully, lest your computer become a paperweight.<br><br>

            To the <span style="color:aqua">EAST(.html)</span> lies the ________.
            
            If you manage to uncover Emulaton, you will find a powerful but empty mech. It has been several centuries since Emulaton was given sentience. The only known code able to control and be hosted by Emulaton is Nano-DOS-ware, a tiny species of code found to grow in the <span style="color:aqua">WEST</span>. <br><br>
            
            Once you have found a copy of this Micro Controller, uniting it with Emulaton is a task of its own. You will need to use <span style="color:aqua">the Terminal</span>.<br><br>

            Only with a sentient Emulaton will you be able to experience the full potential of Treasure Knightâ€”once you recover it from its current captor. Doc Pop is a malicient entity who resides in the <span style="color:aqua">NORTH</span>.
